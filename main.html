	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of its input. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the amount of time it takes to execute. It's crucial to strive for algorithms with lower time complexity to ensure efficient performance.</p>

<p>Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to complete its execution. It's typically denoted by O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input data. Managing space complexity is essential to prevent excessive memory consumption and optimize resource utilization. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical consideration in designing algorithms.</p>
